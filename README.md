### About
This project was originated from a [term project](https://suoglu.github.io/misc/other/Term_Project_Fall_2015-2016+v.1.pdf) and rewritten with [Xilinx Vivado](http://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html) to work on [Digilent Basys 3](https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/programmable-logic/basys-3/reference-manual) FPGA.

* **Inputs:**
  * `Passcode switches (Rightmost 12 switches)`: Used to enter passcode
  * `Bank switch (Leftmost switch)`: Used to open/close bank
  * `Counter switch (2nd leftmost switch)`: Used to open/close counter
  * `Passcode change switch (3rd leftmost switch)`: Used to change passcode
  * `Reset button (Lower button)`: Used to reset system
  * `Customer button (Upper button)`: Used for taking queue number
  * `Teller buttons (Right and left button)`: Used for teller actions, effects to the system changes according to the leftmost three switches.
  
* **Outputs:**
  * `Bank LED (Leftmost LED)`: Shows if the bank is open or not
  * `Counter LEDs (Rightmost two LEDs)`: Shows if the corresponding counter is open or not
  * `Wait LED (9th LED from left site)`: Shows if the system is waiting for teller action to complete a process
  * `Seven Segment Displays`: Can show different things according to other signals
    * `Default`: Last called customer for the tellers (Right two for one teller, left two for the other)
    * `When customer takes number`: For one, second left two seven-segment displays are blank, right two seven-segment displays show taken number. Seven-segment displays blink within a period of 0.5 second and duty cycle of 50%.
    * `Bank closed`: Writes "CLSd"
    * `If tellers try to close bank while there is/are customer(s) waiting and/or there is an open counter`: "rCXX", where XX number of remaining customer(s)
  
  
* **System description:**
  * This project provides a queue management system with two tellers. 
  * Each teller has a 12-bit passcode. Initial values for the passcodes are 12'b0. Tellers can change their passcode when the bank is open using passcode change switch. While passcode change switch is on, tellers that want to change their passcode enters old passcode and pushes their button. Later, they enter a new passcode and push their button. To cancel this process, teller can turn passcode switch off. 
  * Tellers can open and close their counter using counter switch while the bank is open. Tellers that want to open/close their counter enters their passcode and pushes their button. 
  * To open/close bank, the bank switch is turned on to system to enter open/close state. Tellers enters their passcodes and pushes their buttons one after other. Later the bank switch should be turned off. Bank cannot be closed while there is/are waiting customer(s) or/and any of the counters is open.
  * Customers take numbers by pushing the customer button.
  * Tellers call the next customer by pressing teller button while leftmost three switches are off. Tellers cannot call the next customer if the next customer does not exist.
  * The system can be reset asynchronously with reset button.

### Simulation
Designed system was successfully simulated using [`sim.v`](https://github.com/suoglu/Queue-Management-System/blob/master/Simulation/sim.v) file, which is included in the repository. [`sim.v`](https://github.com/suoglu/Queue-Management-System/blob/master/Simulation/sim.v) file contains a short scenario, in which I try to cover all possible situations.

**Important note:** For the system to work properly at simulation [`Counters.v`](https://github.com/suoglu/Queue-Management-System/blob/master/Sources/Counters.v) file should be edited as commented on line 8 and 65.

### Implementation
Design can be implemented on [Digilent Basys 3](https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/programmable-logic/basys-3/reference-manual) FPGA using verilog files in the [Sources](https://github.com/suoglu/Queue-Management-System/tree/master/Sources) folder and provided constrains file, [`cons.xdc`](https://github.com/suoglu/Queue-Management-System/blob/master/Constrains/cons.xdc).

**Important note:** The system is designed and tested for 100MHz clock frequency, for other clock frequencies files [`Counters.v`](https://github.com/suoglu/Queue-Management-System/blob/master/Sources/Counters.v) and [`ssd.v`](https://github.com/suoglu/Queue-Management-System/blob/master/Sources/ssd.v) should be edited as commented.

**Important note:** In decoder module at [`SevenSegmentDisplayDecoders.v`](https://github.com/suoglu/Queue-Management-System/blob/master/Sources/SevenSegmentDisplayDecoders.v) abcdefg signals (assigned to ssdN buses at [`board.v`](https://github.com/suoglu/Queue-Management-System/blob/master/Sources/board.v)) assigned as, where a is most significant bit (msb) and g is least significant bit (lsb). However, at [`board.v`](https://github.com/suoglu/Queue-Management-System/blob/master/Sources/board.v) I connected ssdN buses (which contains abcdefg signals) in reverse order by mistake. (i.g. a is connected to lsb of ssdN buses and g connected to msb of ssdN buses). I fixed my mistake by connecting pins at reverse order at constrains file, [`cons.xdc`](https://github.com/suoglu/Queue-Management-System/blob/master/Constrains/cons.xdc).
